    <h1>Democratic Elections and Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem</h1>
    <p>
        This project delves into <strong>Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem</strong>, a cornerstone of social choice theory that 
        mathematically proves the limitations of democratic voting systems. The theorem rigorously demonstrates that no voting 
        system can satisfy all five fairness axioms when three or more candidates are involved. These axioms are:
    </p>
    <h2>The Five Axioms:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Unrestricted Domain:</strong> Voters can rank candidates in any order, with no restrictions on their preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives:</strong> Introducing or removing a candidate should not affect the relative ranking of other candidates.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Dictatorship:</strong> No single voter’s preferences can dictate the group’s preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Ordering:</strong> The voting system must produce consistent and transitive group preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Pareto Efficiency:</strong> If all voters prefer one candidate over another, the group must also prefer that candidate.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mathematical Focus:</strong> The project includes formal mathematical proofs, logical reasoning, and examples to illustrate each axiom and their implications.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof Walkthrough:</strong> A structured, multi-part proof explains how any voting system satisfying Pareto Efficiency and Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives inevitably leads to a dictatorship.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessible Explanations:</strong> Definitions, examples, and step-by-step derivations make the complex math more approachable.</li>
    </ul>

        This repository is a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the intersection of mathematics, politics, and ethics, 
        offering an in-depth, math-heavy exploration of why creating a perfectly fair voting system is impossible.
